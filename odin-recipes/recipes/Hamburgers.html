            These air fryer hamburgers are perfect for when it's too cold to
            grill and you're craving a juicy burger! The butter and bouillon
            mixture gives these air fryer hamburger patties a dark grilled color
            and deep beefy flavor. Add your favorite seasonings, if desired, but
            these are delicious as is! If you'd like to add cheese, turn off the
            air fryer once the patties are done and let the residual heat melt
            the cheese. Make sure you use cold meat, straight from the fridge,
            for best results.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon beef base (such as Better than BouillonÂ®)</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 1</h3>
              <p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (195 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 2</h3>
              <p>
                Form beef into 4 patties, approximately 3/4 inches thick and 4
                1/2 inches in diameter. Make the patties slightly bigger than
                the buns to allow for shrinkage.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 3</h3>
              <p>
                Whisk together warm melted butter and beef soup base in a small
                bowl. Brush lightly onto both sides of patties and season with
                pepper. Set patties into the air fryer basket. Depending on the
                size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Step 4</h3>
              <p>
                Air-fry patties for 7 minutes, flipping halfway through, for
                medium doneness. For well done, air-fry for an additional 2
                minutes.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
          <p>
            This recipe was developed using a 2.8-quart basket-style air fryer.
            Results will vary depending on air fryer size and brand, and
            thickness of your patties. You may need to adjust cook time to
            achieve your preferred degree of doneness. If excessive smoking
            occurs, add water to bottom of air fryer to help prevent dripping
            grease from burning.
